# Open Data Hack 2023

**Goal:** Use an AI model to predict the fill levels of recycling stations in St. Gallen
and create a pathfinding algorithm that finds the ideal routes for city employees.

### Components

1) AI model that predicts future fill levels based on historic data
2) Pathfinding algorithm that finds the optimal order of recycling stations based on the predicted fill levels
3) Optional: Visualise optimal route with a web app or similar

### Setup

Download the file [here](https://www.daten.stadt.sg.ch/explore/dataset/fullstandssensoren-sammelstellen-stadt-stgallen/export/?disjunctive.name&disjunctive.tags&sort=measured_at) 
and safe it at `data/fill-level.csv` or use the `download-data.sh` script.

### API

Document the api for pathfinding, in progress...
